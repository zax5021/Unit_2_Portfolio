# Zack Campbell Developer Porfolio
-- Unit 2 Homework 1 -- Zack Campbell

## Description

Using advanced (relatively) css, specifically flexbox and other screen size dependent properties, we created a sample designer porfolio. Having the sample image links scale with different screen sizes was crucial.


## Installation

Not much to it as far as I can tell, the repository is public to feel free to grab any of the files or take a look at the finished product [here.](https://zax5021.github.io/Unit_2_Portfolio/)
